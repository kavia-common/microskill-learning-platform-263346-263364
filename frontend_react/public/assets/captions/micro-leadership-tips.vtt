00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Practice micro‑leadership daily with small actions.

00:04.200 --> 00:08.000
Make clear asks: who, what, when, and why.

00:08.200 --> 00:12.000
Celebrate small wins publicly and specifically.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.000
Unblock decisively: remove one barrier today.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.000
Model curiosity—ask one open question per meeting.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.000
Set guardrails, not micromanagement.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.000
Close loops: confirm ownership and next check‑in.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.000
Consistency builds trust more than big speeches.
