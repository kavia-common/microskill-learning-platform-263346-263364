00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
G‑M‑A is a quick loop: Goals, Methods, Actions.

00:04.200 --> 00:08.000
Goals: define the outcome in one clear sentence.

00:08.200 --> 00:12.000
Methods: list ways to reach the goal—constraints and resources.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.000
Pick the simplest method that fits your context.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.000
Actions: translate method into the next 1–3 concrete steps.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.000
Time‑box each step and set a visible checkpoint.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.000
Run the loop again after your checkpoint to recalibrate.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.000
Keep the loop small to maintain momentum and clarity.
