00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Inbox taking over your day? Let’s clear it fast.

00:04.000 --> 00:16.000
Batch email into two windows—morning and afternoon. Mute notifications the rest of the day.

00:16.000 --> 00:34.000
Triage with the four Ds: Delete noise. Delegate what others should handle. Do anything under two minutes. Defer everything else by scheduling it.

00:34.000 --> 00:50.000
Give emails a home: Action for your short list, Waiting for follow-ups, and Archive for everything searchable.

00:50.000 --> 01:02.000
In practice: delete promos, delegate invoices, reply to quick messages, and defer long drafts with a date.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Recap: batch windows, four‑D triage, three folders. Action tip: add two calendar blocks today and start the kata. When you’re ready, take the quiz.
