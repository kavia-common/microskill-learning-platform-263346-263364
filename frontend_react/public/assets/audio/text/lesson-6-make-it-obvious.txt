Lesson six. Make it Obvious with habit stacking.
Formula: After I [current habit], I will [new micro action].
Examples: After I make coffee, I will review my top three priorities. After I end a meeting, I will schedule the next step before closing the tab.
Reduce friction: place cues in sight, keep materials ready, make the start easy.
Micro-challenge: write one stack you can perform today, and do it once.
Result: consistent action, visible progress, better habits.
