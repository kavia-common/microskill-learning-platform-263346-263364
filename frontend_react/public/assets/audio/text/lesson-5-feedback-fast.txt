Lesson five. Feedback in 30 seconds with SBI: Situation, Behavior, Impact.
Situation: yesterday's client call.
Behavior: you interrupted twice.
Impact: the client paused and the conversation slowed.
Make it timely, specific, and action-focused. Offer a forward step: for the next call, wait for a full second before jumping in.
Micro-challenge: give one SBI feedback today, and ask for one in return.
Result: clearer signals, faster improvement, better trust.
