Lesson two. The Two-Minute Rule.
If a task takes less than two minutes, do it now. Otherwise, schedule it on your calendar or next-actions list.
Why it works: it preserves momentum, prevents tiny tasks from piling up, and keeps your system trustworthy.
Micro-challenge: For the next hour, apply the Two-Minute Rule to every new task. Capture longer tasks with a clear next action and a time slot.
Result: lower friction, a cleaner mind, and reliable follow-through.
