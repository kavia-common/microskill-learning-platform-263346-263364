Lesson four. The 60-Second Focus Reset.
We will use a short breathing pattern and a micro-stretch to reset attention.
Step one: inhale for four, hold for four, exhale for four. Repeat three cycles.
Step two: roll shoulders back and down, stretch your neck gently side to side, unclench your jaw.
Step three: pick the next single task. Close extra tabs and notifications.
Result: lower cognitive load, calmer breathing, sharper focus.
