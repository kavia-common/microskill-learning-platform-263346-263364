Lesson three. Make a Clear Ask with the CTA formula.
Context: one sentence on why this matters.
Task: what needs doing.
Ask: a specific owner and deadline.
Example: Context—Our release slipped due to unclear handoffs. Task—draft the handoff checklist. Ask—Taylor, first draft by Wednesday 4 p.m.
Micro-challenge: Rewrite your next request using Context, Task, Ask.
Result: fewer back-and-forths, clearer ownership, faster outcomes.
