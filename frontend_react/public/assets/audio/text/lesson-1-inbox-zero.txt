Lesson one. Inbox Zero in minutes.
Triage emails with three labels: Act. Defer. Archive.
If it takes less than two minutes, label Act and do it in your next batch window.
If it needs more time, label Defer, then schedule it.
If no action is required, label Archive and move on.
Batch responses twice daily to reduce context switching.
Close the inbox between batches to protect focus.
Micro-challenge: Set two 15-minute windows today—morning and afternoon. Triage using Act, Defer, Archive.
Result: a calmer inbox, faster decisions, and more deep work.
