# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

Environment
- Copy .env.example to .env and set:
  - REACT_APP_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001
  - Optionally REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
- Backend must set FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 in backend/.env to pass CORS for browser requests.

Media generation
- The app calls POST {API_BASE}/api/generate-media to create:
  - /assets/video/mp4/{slug}.mp4
  - /assets/captions/{slug}.vtt
- Diagnostics panel includes a “Test media generation” button and references a screenshot at /assets/diagnostics-latest.png.

Diagnostics
- The Diagnostics panel (top of pages via Layout) checks health, API endpoints, and asset availability.
- It expects generated media to be served from the backend at:
  - /assets/video/mp4/{slug}.mp4
  - /assets/captions/{slug}.vtt
- Use the "Test media generation" button to create a sample set for the slug "inbox-zero—micro-lesson" (slugified).

Troubleshooting
- CORS: Ensure backend FRONTEND_ORIGIN matches your frontend origin exactly (http://localhost:3000).
- Ports: If you change backend PORT, update REACT_APP_API_BASE to match.
- Asset 404: Confirm backend serves /assets and re-run media generation.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
